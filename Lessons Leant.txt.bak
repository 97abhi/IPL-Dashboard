1. The main function class should be in the main directory. It shhould not be on the same level of hirearchy as other classes files.
2. The files that we dont need git to add it in repo online we can add that directory in .gitignore such as node_modules of react app.
.env file
whatever properties we add in .env file is accessible to entire app through process.env.(name of the field) similar to application.properties in Spring Boot
3. we can build the react app first by npm build and then build the spring boot app as its the container in which the react app will
   be present. And we build the spring boot app by running ./mvnm install
4. After doing the npm build and ./mvnw install we need to copy all the files of the react app which is present in build directory 
   and place it in main/resource/public directory since whatever html file you place there will be called first and from then on
   react can start and interact with spring boot and so on.
